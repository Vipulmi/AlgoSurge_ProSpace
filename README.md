This repo contains the code for the assignment of the surgical computer vision project offered by ProSpace under the file img_segmentation.ipynb.

In this code, I have utilised the perks of transfer learning by using the pre-trained weights of maskrcnn_resnet50 model using the torchvision library. Then I have shown each mask using the cv2_imshow function which successfully demonstrates instance segmentation.

Note: In this code, the image ,over which segmentation needs to be performed, is imported by specifying the URL of the image taken from the net.
